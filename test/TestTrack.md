    For Example : 'miso','tiso' > 2 : m & t are not matched❌ & others words matched✅;

    Algorithm : make a variable and store two string > take a two string length - 1 > set the currVale 0 > use while loops and match the conditon > increment value > decrement index of the two string > return total length - matching value.

    #### I HAVE LEARNED : HOW TO REVERSE THE STRING AND MATCH;
