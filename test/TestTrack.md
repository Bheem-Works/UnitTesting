    ## Date : may 14 2025 Wednesday || CreditCardChecker
    Question in roman nepali > Credit Card valid xa ki xaina bhanera check garne function banaune ho, Luhn algorithm use garera.
    👣 Step-by-step:
    1. Right bata suru garne (last digit check digit ho).

    2. Tyes check digit ko agadi ko duita dui digit lai double garne.

    3. Double garepachi value 9 bhanda thulo xa bhane, tyes bata 9 subtract garne.
    Example:

    8 * 2 = 16 → 16 - 9 = 7

    7 * 2 = 14 → 14 - 9 = 5

    4. Aba sabai digit haru ko value add garne (sum).

    5.Final sum 10 le divide hunchha (sum % 10 === 0) vane → card valid ✅
    Na hune bhaye → invalid ❌

    🧪 Input Format:
    String ma aauxa, jasma 4-4 digit haru space le separate cha.

    🔚 Output:
    Return true if valid, false if invalid.

    ## Date : may 17 2025 sunday || ShiftLeft;
    Question : You have given a two string and you have to match that string from the left and if it doesn't matched then shew how many letter , words are un matched. If it is then show 0; 
    For Example : 'miso','tiso' > 2 : m & t are not matched❌ & others words matched✅;

    Algorithm : make a variable and store two string > take a two string length - 1 > set the currVale 0 > use while loops and match the conditon > increment value > decrement index of the two string > return total length - matching value.

    #### I HAVE LEARNED : HOW TO REVERSE THE STRING AND MATCH;
    > YOU CAN REVERSE THE STRING BY USIN THE LOOPS AND USE THE .LENGTH-1 WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE LAST INDEX AND FROM THAT BY USING THE LOOPS YOU CAN DECREMENT THE VALUE. AND GET THE REVERSED STRING;

    ## Date : may 20 Wednesday || MexicanWave 
    Question in English : In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return an array of strings where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.

    Algorithm : emptyArrayForStore > loop through > use the continue if it is white space > conver it to the new array by using split > convert it to the upperCase > and join it

    ###  I HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE CONTINUE AND HOW THE SPLIT WORKS.
    > Split : helps to create a refresh new array after each calls. Conitnue: it helps to skip the loops and continue;
